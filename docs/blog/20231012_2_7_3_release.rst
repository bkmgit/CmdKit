Release Notes (v2.7.3)
======================

`October 12, 2023`

The v2.7.3 release fixes a bug in how ``_env`` and ``_eval`` get expanded
(`Issue 21 <https://github.com/glentner/CmdKit/issues/21>`_)

-----


The expected behavior is something like the following:

.. code-block:: python

    cfg = Configuration(default={'database': {'user': 'bob', 'password_eval': 'echo secret'}})
    assert cfg.database.password == 'secret'

The expansion does happen for top-level parameters, but not ones nested within sections (or sub-sections).
You instead get an ``AttributeError`` as you might expect from a normal dictionary.

With the 2.7.x release of cmdkit the ``Namespace`` (and underlying ``NSCoreMixin`` along with ``Environ``) were
migrated to their own separate ``namespace`` module to allow for it to be used in the new ``platform`` module
without created a circular dependency with the original ``config`` module.

The implementation of this expansion functionality was pulled out of ``NSCoreMixin`` and implemented
instead directly in the ``Configuration`` class. This might make sense conceptional, as it's the
configuration that needs this behavior. However, implementing it there destroys the recursive
nature of the structure. As soon as you access a section of the ``Configuration`` instead you get
a ``Namespace`` view, not another ``Configuration``.

The expansion behavior was reverted back to its original home under ``NSCoreMixin``.
All ``Namespace`` instances allow this sort of expansion, as in prior releases.
